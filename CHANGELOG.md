# Change Log

## [2.1.1]
Added deprecation notice

## [2.1.0]
Added new setting `onSave`. Defaults to false. When true it triggers the sort command on each save.

## [2.0.0]
We moved the backend logic to @snowcoders/sortier which is a cli application so it works outside of vs-code! We had a few people still using webstorm which was the idea behind this. So this application basically just uses that cli tool from now on.

## [1.0.0]
- Initial release
